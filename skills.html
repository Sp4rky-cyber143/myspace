    <h3>WHY BEING GOOD AT CODING HELPS YOUR FUTURE</h3>
    <P>Very often the ability to learn coding is taking nowadays a a sign that you have talent that can be tapped for an employer's use and also have a brain between the ears. You have to be able to solve problems and be tenacious in doing so, and this is something that is always an asset in fields technical and non-technical. You have an advantage if an employer wants someone who is good in a field such as chemistry and also might understand how to write programs for use in a laboratory. You can find yourself being hired not just for a non-technical job that requires that you have problem solving skills but also can do light coding for the foreseeable future in that job. I personally knew someone who was a proofreader of technical journals who knew a bit about coding. It turned out that the boss talked to a vice president about this fact, and to make a long story short the employee in question was transferred to a job in the IT department, and this with a substantial increase in pay. The person had substantial amounts of talent that had not been previously been guessed at and the company was not about to lose the opportunity presented to keep and use this bonanza that had been totally unexpected. There was one other fact that had come into play and that was the fact that they didn't want to have to contract with a technical recruiter to fill that position.</P>
